# DataSets
Sample CSV and XLXS files for the practise of data handling and cleaning 
There are many forms of data such as private and public but we need to use them ethically and morally
So,there is a lot of open source data that can be availabe freely
and there is also some public data where we need to have a proper authorization
And coming to the private data 
      "we dont have access for that and it may be illegal to access or have that data"
What ever the data is we should not violet the data ethicaly and morally .
